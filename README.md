# Face-Detection-with-OpenCV-and-dlib
This Python code utilizes OpenCV, dlib, and matplotlib to perform face detection using the Haar Cascade algorithm. Additionally, it detects eyes and smiles within the detected faces. The code takes an image file as input, applies the cascades, and displays the result with the boxes around the detected faces, eyes, and smiles.
